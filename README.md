First Java Code
This project contains the first Java code I ever wrote. It is a simple "Hello, World!" program that prints a greeting to the console.

Getting Started
To run the program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
java -version
If Java is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Java website.

Once Java is installed, you can run the program by following these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-java-code.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd first-java-code
Compile the program:

Copy code
javac HelloWorld.java
Run the program:

Copy code
java HelloWorld
You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed to the console.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my Java instructor for introducing me to the language and inspiring me to pursue programming. Without their guidance, I wouldn't have been able to write this code.
