<h1 align="center">First Java program</h1>
<p align="center">The first code for Java coding.</p>
<h2 align="center">Deceleration:üìü</h2>

- This project contains the first Java code I ever wrote. It is a simple "Hello, World!" program that prints a greeting to the console.

<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>

- To run the program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

<h1 align="center">Copy code</h1>
java -version
If Java is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Java website.

Once Java is installed, you can run the program by following these steps:

<h1 align="center">Clone the repository:</h1>

bash
Copy code
<h3 align=" center" >local machine:üì∫ </h3>

<p  align=" center" >git clone :üìù<br> https://github.com/your-username/first-java-code.git</p>
  
Navigate to the project directory:



bash
Copy code
cd first-java-code
Compile the program:

Copy code
javac HelloWorld.java
Run the program:

Copy code
java HelloWorld
You should see the message "Hello, World!" printed to the console.
